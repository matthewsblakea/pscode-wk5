// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Print "Is this integer even or odd? Input number: ", new line
Read input and create new variable from it called "testNumber". This will likely occur in the same line of code as the previous step.
// Must specify integer because non-integers cannot be even or odd.
Find remainder of testNumber / 2 using modulus operator. This result is "x"
if x = 0 print "Number is even"
else print "Number is odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Print "Input 5 numbers one at a time"
// Did not specify whether these should be integers or floats.
// Depending on language or need should use floats because we are taking the average.
Read first number = a then new line
Read second number = b then new line
Read third number = c then new line
Read fourth number = d then new line
Read fifth number = e then new line
numAverage = (a+b+c+d+e) / 5
Print "The average of the data is: " then print numAverage, new line
// Some languages like java or python have functions such as sort or min/max built in. These would be used if applicable.
// Otherwise more work may need to be done, but this is pseudocode.
Find minimum of data and set as variable Min
Find maximum of data and set as variable Max
Print "The minimum of the data is: " and print var Min, new line. Print "The maximum of the data is: " and print var Max.
